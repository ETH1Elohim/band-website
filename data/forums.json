One of my most nostalgic moment was listening to Behind The Sun, from their new album, as I drove west on I-70 leaving Colorado and heading into Utah. It was a bright sunny day, and I felt incredibly free. "},{"name":"Adelyn Lehman","title":"Love","message":"Odesza is my favorite band and it's very nostalgic. It reminds me of my teen years - my adolescence if you will. I'll never forget when I was 16 years old listening to Odesza live at Red Rocks Amphitheater while eating special Cheezits that the gall next to me was handing me. <3"},{"name":"Ethan","title":"First Message","message":"This message is brought to you by EJS."}]
